We wanted sub-second vector search across millions of alerts, an API interface that abstracts away the complexity, and we didnâ€™t want to have to worry about database architecture or maintenance.
Peter Silberman 
 
 
CTO 
Pinecone is the #1 vector database.
Dharmesh Shah 
 
 
Founder and CTO 
Pinecone proved to deliver so much value â€” with reduced overhead and ultra-low latencies at scale â€” we didnâ€™t need to do much convincing to move forward.
Samee Zahid 
 
 
Director of Engineering 
Thanks to the Pinecone vector database we can run our high-performance applications across 10+ billion records without breaking a sweat.
Ohad Parush 
 
 
Chief R&D Officer 
Pinecone made it fast and easy to take vector search from research to production, without DevOps. Thanks to their performance and scalability we can provide accurate, reliable, and real-time threat detection to our customers.
