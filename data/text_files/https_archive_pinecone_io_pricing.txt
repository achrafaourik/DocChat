How We Bill 
For each existing index, hourly billing is determined by the 
per-hour-price 
Varies by plan, pod type, pod size, and cloud region. Try our pricing estimator below.
of a pod multiplied by the 
number of pods 
Multiplied by number of replicas, if applicable 
 the index uses. You will be sent an invoice at the end of the month for the total minutes your indexes have been running, regardless of activity. 
Reach out 
 to an expert if you have any questions.
Pods 
An index is made up of pods, which are units of cloud resources (vCPU, RAM, disk) that provide storage and compute for each index. Choose the 
pod type 
 that works best for your use case.
Indexes 
Indexes store your vector embeddings and metadata. Each index uses at least one pod, but you can add more to increase storage capacity.
Scaling 
As you grow, you can scale storage capacity by increasing your pod sizes. You can also increase or decrease throughput when needed, by adding 
replicas 
 to an index.

Advanced Configuration 
You also have the option to configure the pod size and number of 
replicas, both of which you will be able to change even after 
creating your index, to support scaling.
Choose pod size 
 
 
Increasing the pod size will allow you to store more embeddings as you scale.

Frequently Asked Questions 
How many pods will I need?
Since each pod is a bundle of hardware resources (vCPU, RAM, and disk), the required number of pods is affected by multiple factors such as data size (volume, dimensionality, and metadata), metadata cardinality, and desired latency or throughput. We strongly recommend testing with 
your own data 
on different pod types and number of pods, and following our 
tips for performance tuning 
. 
As a 
very rough 
 starting guideline: each s1 pod fits 5M 768-dim vectors, each p1 pod fits 1M 768-dim vectors, and each p2 pod fits 1M 768-dim vectors.
You can also 
contact us 
 for help with sizing and testing.
If I don't run any queries, will I still be charged?
If you have any running indexes, you will be charged for the pods they use whether or not the index is receiving queries.
An s1 pod can hold 5M embeddings, but I have 20M. Can I still use Pinecone?
Yes. On a paid plan you can have indexes running on more than one pod. Add as many pods as you need to achieve your desired capacity and performance.
Can I increase storage capacity after creating an index?
Yes, you can 
vertically scale 
 the size of the pods in an index by factors of x2, x4, and x8. This can be done even after an index is created.
You also have the option to save your current index as a collection and build another index from that collection.
Do I need a separate index for each of my multi-tenant customers?
No, you can store your customers' data in one index and separate them by 
namespace 
or using 
metadata fields 
. 
Do you offer discounts for startups or non-profits?
There is no discount program for startups or non-profits. Our free plan is sufficient for many small and non-critical applications, and our paid plans are designed to scale with you as you grow.
How secure is Pinecone?
Pinecone is SOC2 Type II compliant, and we take security seriously for all users on all plans. Read about 
our security practices 
. 
Where is the user license or the terms of service?
Users accept the 
End-User License Agreement 
 when creating an account.
How do I cancel or downgrade?
You can manage your subscription directly in the console. If you attempt to downgrade to Starter (Free) while exceeding the limits of the Starter plan, you will first need to delete projects or indexes until you are within the limits.
If you upgraded your account through AWS or GCP marketplace, you will need to downgrade it through the marketplace as well.
What’s new with the Starter (free) plan?
We’re making the following changes to the free plan effective April 26th. Existing projects created before April 26th on free accounts will not be affected by these changes: 
- Free plan indexes will now support ~100k 1536-dimensional embeddings with metadata. All users will have access to a single free project and index within a free tier environment.
- Users on the free plan will maintain their free project after upgrading.
- Users no longer need to choose a pod type and configure their free index.
Projects on paid plans are not affected. See the 
announcement 
 for more information.
What if I created a project on the free plan before April 26, 2023?
Effective April 26th, any new project created on a free account will be subject to the 
updated free plan 
. Existing projects created before April 26th on free accounts will not be affected by these changes. Projects on paid plans are not affected.
