🛣️ Roadmap 
Last updated 
The goal of this doc is to align 
core 
and 
community 
 efforts for the project and to share what's in store for this year!

What is the core Chroma team working on right now?
What will Chroma prioritize over the next 6mo?
What areas are great for community contributions?
What is the core Chroma team working on right now?
​ 
🕸️ Replacing Clickhouse with a custom Distributed System 
🌩️ Standing up that distributed system as a managed service (aka "Hosted Chroma" - 
sign up for waitlist 
!) 
🐋 Support for Conda and Dockerhub 
What did the Chroma team just complete?
​ 
Features like: 
🐍 A more minimal python-client only build target 
✋ Google PaLM embedding support 
🎣 OpenAI ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin 
✅ A Robust Test Suite 
The core team implemented a 
hypothesis-based 
 testing suite to battle-harden Chroma’s APIs. This was a big undertaking. We invested the time in this now to enable high development velocity in the near future and to be able to accept community contributions without fear of regressions or bugs.
What will Chroma prioritize over the next 6mo?
​ 
Next Milestone: ☁️ Launch Hosted Chroma 
Areas we will invest in 
Not an exhaustive list, but these are some of the core team’s biggest priorities over the coming few months. Use caution when contributing in these areas and please check-in with the core team first.
⏩ 
Workflow 
: Building tools for answer questions like: what embedding model should I use? And how should I chunk up my documents?
🌌 
Visualization 
: Building visualization tool to give developers greater intuition embedding spaces 
🔀 
Query Planner 
: Building tools to enable per-query and post-query transforms 
🔧 
Developer experience 
: Extending Chroma into a CLI 
📦 
Easier Data Sharing 
: Working on formats for serialization and easier data sharing of embedding Collections 
🔍 
Improving recall 
: Fine-tuning embedding transforms through human feedback 
🧠 
Analytical horsepower 
: Clustering, deduplication, classification and more 
What areas are great for community contributions?
​ 
This is where you have a lot more free rein to contribute (without having to sync with us first)!
If you're unsure about your contribution idea, feel free to chat with us (@chroma) in the 
channel in 
our Discord 
! We'd love to support you however we can.
⚙️ Example Templates 
​ 
We can always use 
more integrations 
 with the rest of the AI ecosystem. Please let us know if you're working on one and need help!
Other great starting points for Chroma (please send PRs for more 
here 
): 
Google Colab 
Replit Template 
For those integrations we do have, like 
and 
, we do always want more tutorials, demos, workshops, videos, and podcasts (we've done some pods 
on our blog 
). 
📦 Example Datasets 
​ 
It doesn’t make sense for developers to embed the same information over and over again with the same embedding model.
We'd like suggestions for: 
"small" (<100 rows) 
"medium" (<5MB) 
"large" (>1GB) 
datasets for people to stress test Chroma in a variety of scenarios.
⚖️ Embeddings Comparison 
​ 
Chroma does ship with Sentence Transformers by default for embeddings, but we are otherwise unopinionated about what embeddings you use. Having a library of information that has been embedded with many models, alongside example query sets would make it much easier for empirical work to be done on the effectiveness of various models across different domains.

Huggingface Benchmark of a bunch of Embeddings 
notable issues with GPT3 Embeddings 
and alternatives to consider 
⚗️ Experimental Algorithms 
​ 
If you have a research background, please consider adding to our 
s. For example: 
Projections (t-sne, UMAP, the new hotness, the one you just wrote) and Lightweight visualization 
Clustering (HDBSCAN, PCA) 
Deduplication 
Multimodal (CLIP) 
Fine-tuning manifold with human feedback 
eg 
Expanded vector search (MMR, Polytope) 
Your research 
🧑‍💻️ Additional Client SDKs 
​ 
We will be happy to work with people maintaining additional client SDKs as part of the community. Specifically: 
Ruby 
Clojure 
Elixir 
You can find the REST OpenAPI spec at 
 when the backend is running.
Please 
reach out 
 and talk to us before you get too far in your projects so that we can offer technical guidance/align on roadmap.
